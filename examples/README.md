Ruby Examples
============

These examples are scripts that can be run independently to demonstrate the Rosette API functionality.

You can run your desired `_endpoint_.rb` file to see it in action.

`ruby _endpoint_.rb api_key(required) alternate_url(optional)`

For example, run `ruby categories.js <your_key>` if you want to see the categories
functionality demonstrated.

All files require you to input your Rosette API User Key after `--key` to run.
For example: `ruby ping.js 1234567890`

To run all of the examples:
`find -maxdepth 1 -name *.rb -exec ruby {} api_key alternate_url`

Each example, when run, prints its output to the console.
